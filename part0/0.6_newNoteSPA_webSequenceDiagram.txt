note over browser:
browser starts executing js-code when the form submit is required
it prevents the default behavior of the form submit to happen
preventing that a regular POST request is done like when on classical web site.
Then it creates a new note, adds it to the notes list
rerenders the note list on the page, the new note will then appear,
and sends the new note to the server.
end note
